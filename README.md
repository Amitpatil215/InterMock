## Motivation Behind this project
We are frequently overwhelmed by the number of interviews applied for on each portal, and we lose track of them at times.
We also require some time to conduct research into the organisation and its objectives.
As a result, preparing around interview dates is the greatest bet an intervieweeÂ can make.
